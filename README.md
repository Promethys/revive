**Revive** is a plugin for [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com) that brings a central **Recycle Bin** to your application. It lets you restore or permanently delete soft-deleted Eloquent models in just a few clicks.

This plugin is especially useful for SaaS applications, admin dashboards, or any multi-user platform where recovering accidentally deleted data is important.

## Features

- View, restore, and permanently delete soft-deleted records from a dedicated Filament page
- Register multiple models as "Recyclable" with a simple trait
- Filter items by model type or search through deleted records
- Customize the plugin's appearance and behavior with ease
- User and multi-tenancy support (**⌛ in development, available in v2**)
- Filament V4 support (**available in v2**)


---

## ⚠️ Filament v4 Compatibility

Filament v4 is currently in **beta**, and this plugin does **not support** it yet.

We will begin testing and adapting the package soon. Until then, please use this plugin with **Filament v3.x** only.

> Trying to install this plugin on Filament v4 may result in unexpected errors or breaking changes.

Stay tuned for updates when full support becomes available.

---

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require promethys/revive
php artisan revive:install
```

If you prefer to manually publish and run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="revive-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

---

## Configuration

Register the plugin in your panel:

```php
use Promethys\Revive\RevivePlugin;

$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
]);
```

You can also customize the plugin using fluent configuration:

```php
use Promethys\Revive\RevivePlugin;

$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->authorize(auth()->user()->isAdmin()) // Accepts a boolean or Closure to control access
        ->navigationGroup('Settings') // Group the page under a custom sidebar section
        ->navigationIcon('heroicon-o-archive-box-arrow-down')
        ->activeNavigationIcon('heroicon-o-archive-box-arrow-down')
        ->navigationSort(1)
        ->navigationLabel('Custom Label')
        ->title('Custom Title')
        ->slug('custom-slug')
]);
```

> ⚠️ The plugin currently supports only models in the `App\Models` namespace. 
> If you want to register a third-party model (e.g., from another package), create a wrapper class that extends it and add the `Recyclable` trait there: 

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Promethys\Revive\Traits\Recyclable;
use Vendor\Package\Models\Foo as BaseFoo;

class Foo extends BaseFoo
{
    use SoftDeletes;
    use Recyclable;
}
```

---

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed and configured, you'll see a new page in your Filament navigation menu.  
From there, users can restore deleted data or permanently remove it.

> In v1, Revive will show all the Recyclable records in a single table, without any user-specific scope. 
> You may use the plugin in your admin panel for now. 
> User-specific scope will be available in v2.

### 1. Add the `Recyclable` trait to any soft-deletable model

```php
use Promethys\Revive\Concerns\Recyclable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
    use Recyclable;
}
```

> ℹ️ **Important:** Adding the `Recyclable` trait without using `SoftDeletes` will throw an exception.

### 2. Optional: Discover existing soft-deleted records

If you already have soft-deleted records before installing the plugin, you'll soon be able to "discover" them by running:

```bash
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted
```

> 🧪 *This command is planned for v2.*

---

## Use the table outside the default page

You don't have to register the plugin in your panel to use the table.

Instead, you can render the Livewire component directly in a Blade view:

```php
@livewire(\Promethys\Revive\Tables\RecycleBin::class)
```

This is ideal if:
- You don't want to clutter your navigation
- You're not using Filament Panels but still want a recycle bin in your app
