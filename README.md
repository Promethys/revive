**Revive** is a plugin for [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com) that brings a central **Recycle Bin** to your application. It lets you restore or permanently delete soft-deleted Eloquent models in just a few clicks.

This plugin is especially useful for SaaS applications, admin dashboards, or any multi-user platform where recovering accidentally deleted data is important.

php artisan migrate

# 3. Update your plugin configuration (see Migration guide below)
```


---

## Configuration

Register the plugin in each panel where you want the recycle bin available:

```php
use Promethys\Revive\RevivePlugin;

$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
]);
```

You can also customize the plugin using fluent configuration:

```php
use Promethys\Revive\RevivePlugin;

$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->authorize(auth()->user()->isAdmin()) // Accepts a boolean or Closure to control access
        ->navigationGroup('Settings') // Group the page under a custom sidebar section
        ->navigationIcon('heroicon-o-archive-box-arrow-down')
        ->activeNavigationIcon('heroicon-o-archive-box-arrow-down')
        ->navigationSort(1)
        ->navigationLabel('Custom Label')
        ->title('Custom Title')
        ->slug('custom-slug')
]);
```

### User and Multi-Tenancy Configuration (V2)

**V2** introduces powerful scoping features that allow users to see only their own deleted items or items within their tenant/organization:

```php
use Promethys\Revive\RevivePlugin;

// Basic user-scoped recycle bin (users only see their own deleted items)
$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->enableUserScoping() // Default: true
        ->enableTenantScoping(false)
]);

// Multi-tenant recycle bin
$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->enableTenantScoping() // Default: true
        ->enableUserScoping(false)
]);

// Admin panel - see all deleted items
$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->showAllRecords() // Shows all records regardless of user/tenant
        ->authorize(fn () => auth()->user()->isAdmin())
]);

// Custom model filtering
$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->models([Post::class, Comment::class]) // Only show these models
        ->enableUserScoping()
]);

// Completely disable scoping (like v1 behavior)
$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->withoutScoping()
]);
```

#### Examples of configuration for Different Panel Types

**User Panel Configuration:**
```php
// User panel - users only see their own deleted items
public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->id('user')
        ->plugins([
            RevivePlugin::make()
                ->navigationGroup('My Account')
                ->navigationLabel('My Deleted Items')
                ->title('My Recycle Bin')
                ->enableUserScoping(true)
                ->enableTenantScoping(false)
        ]);
}
```

**Admin Panel Configuration:**
```php
// Admin panel - see all deleted items across all users/tenants
public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->id('admin')
        ->plugins([
            RevivePlugin::make()
                ->navigationGroup('Administration')
                ->navigationLabel('Global Recycle Bin')
                ->title('All Deleted Items')
                ->showAllRecords()
                ->authorize(fn () => auth()->user()->isAdmin())
        ]);
}
```

**Tenant Panel Configuration:**
```php
// Tenant panel - see deleted items for current tenant only
public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->id('tenant')
        ->tenant(Team::class)
        ->plugins([
            RevivePlugin::make()
                ->navigationGroup('Team Management')
                ->navigationLabel('Team Recycle Bin')
                ->title('Team Deleted Items')
                ->enableTenantScoping()
                ->enableUserScoping(false) // All team members can see all team deletions
        ]);
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The plugin currently supports only models in the `App\Models` namespace. 
> If you want to register a third-party model (e.g., from another package), create a wrapper class that extends it and add the `Recyclable` trait there: 

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Promethys\Revive\Concerns\Recyclable;
use Vendor\Package\Models\Foo as BaseFoo;

class Foo extends BaseFoo
{
    use SoftDeletes;
    use Recyclable;
}
```

---

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed and configured, you'll see a new page in your Filament navigation menu.  
From there, users can restore deleted data or permanently remove it.

### 1. Add the `Recyclable` trait to any soft-deletable model

```php
use Promethys\Revive\Concerns\Recyclable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
    use Recyclable;
}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Important:** Adding the `Recyclable` trait without using `SoftDeletes` will throw an exception.

### 2. Advanced User Scoping (V2)

#### Custom User and Tenant Detection

Override these methods in your models to customize how users and tenants are detected:

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes, Recyclable;

    /**
     * Get the user who should be recorded as deleting this model
     * This would override the default method
     */
    public function getDeletedByUser()
    {
        // Custom logic - maybe you store it in a different field
        return $this->deleted_by_user_id ?? auth()->id();
    }

    /**
     * Get the tenant ID for this model
     * This would override the default method
     */
    public function getTenantId()
    {
        // For teams/organizations
        return $this->organization_id;
        
        // Or for complex tenant relationships
        return $this->workspace->tenant_id ?? null;
    }
}
```

#### Multi-Tenancy Patterns

**Filament Multi-Tenancy Integration:**
The plugin automatically detects Filament tenancy:

```php
// In your panel service provider
$panel->plugins([
    RevivePlugin::make()
        ->enableTenantScoping() // Automatically uses filament()->getTenant()
]);
```

**Custom Tenant Models:**
```php
class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes, Recyclable;
    
    public function getTenantId()
    {
        // For Filament Multi-tenancy
        return filament()->getTenant()->id ?? null;

        // For custom team-based tenancy
        return $this->team_id;

        // For organization-based tenancy
        return $this->organization_id;
    }
}
```

### 3. Optional: Discover existing soft-deleted records

If you already have soft-deleted records before installing the plugin, you can "discover" them by running:

```bash
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted
```

This command will:
- Scan all models that use the `Recyclable` trait
- Find existing soft-deleted records that aren't already tracked in the recycle bin
- Add them to the plugin's tracking system so they appear in the Filament page

#### Command Options

**Preview changes without making them:**
```bash
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted --dry-run
```

**Include user/tenant scoping information (V2):**
```bash
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted --with-scope
```
This option attempts to determine who deleted each record and includes tenant information.

**Discover records for a specific model:**
```bash
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted --model=Product
# or use the full class name
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted --model="App\Models\Shop\Product"
```

**Combine options:**
```bash
php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted --model=Category --dry-run --with-scope
```

#### Example Output

```bash
$ php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted --with-scope

Discovering soft-deleted records...

üîç Scanning Category...
   No soft-deleted records found.
üîç Scanning Comment...
   ‚úÖ 0/3 records discovered
üîç Scanning Brand...
   ‚úÖ 8/8 records discovered
üîç Scanning Category...
   ‚úÖ 2/2 records discovered
üîç Scanning Customer...
   ‚úÖ 0/1 records discovered
üîç Scanning Order...
   No soft-deleted records found.
üîç Scanning Product...
   ‚úÖ 12/15 records discovered

üîç User/tenant scoping information was included

‚ú® Discovery completed:
   ‚Ä¢ 29 total soft-deleted records scanned
   ‚Ä¢ 22 new records discovered and added to recycle bin
```

> **üí° Tips:** 
> - Run the command with `--dry-run` first to preview what will be discovered, especially on production systems with large amounts of existing data.
> - Use `--with-scope` when upgrading from V1 to V2 to include user/tenant information for existing records.
> - For large systems with extensive output, consider redirecting the command output to a file: `php artisan revive:discover-soft-deleted > discovery-results.txt`

---

## Use the table outside the default page

You don't have to register the plugin in your panel to use the table.

Instead, you can render the Livewire component directly in a Blade view:

### Basic Usage

```php
@livewire(\Promethys\Revive\Tables\RecycleBin::class)
```

### Advanced Usage with Scoping (V2)

```php
<!-- User-scoped recycle bin -->
@livewire(\Promethys\Revive\Tables\RecycleBin::class, [
    'user' => auth()->user(),
    'enableUserScoping' => true,
    'enableTenantScoping' => false,
])

<!-- Admin view - all records -->
@livewire(\Promethys\Revive\Tables\RecycleBin::class, [
    'showAllRecords' => true,
])

<!-- Tenant-specific recycle bin -->
@livewire(\Promethys\Revive\Tables\RecycleBin::class, [
    'tenant' => filament()->getTenant(),
    'enableTenantScoping' => true,
    'enableUserScoping' => false,
])

<!-- Specific models only -->
@livewire(\Promethys\Revive\Tables\RecycleBin::class, [
    'models' => [App\Models\Post::class, App\Models\Comment::class],
    'user' => auth()->user(),
])
```

This is ideal if:
- You don't want to clutter your navigation
- You're not using Filament Panels but still want a recycle bin in your app
- You want different scoping rules for different parts of your application

---

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

Always ensure proper authorization:

```php
RevivePlugin::make()
    ->authorize(function () {
        return auth()->user()->can('view-recycle-bin'); // Or any other logic. Ensure you return a boolean.
    });
```

> If you use the Tenant scoping of the plugin, please check the Filament [Multi-tenancy security section](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/users/tenancy#tenancy-security) to understand the security implications of multi-tenancy and how to properly implement it.
